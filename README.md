# Hosted on Github Pages - [Here](https://kentuckyfriedrice.github.io/StudentRoulette/)
I made this webpage so I could use it in class to easily pick students.
Many times, students don't want to volunteer in class. Since at my school at least, students are assigned numbers, I took advantage of that system.
We used a different web page before but when our class was being observed, we had a time when an inappropriate advertisement appeared. 
Therefore, I decided to make this despite the many options available.

I tried making a few themes for each season but I haven't finished those for spring and summer yet.
