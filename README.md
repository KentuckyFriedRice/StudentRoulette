# Hosted on Github Pages - [Here](https://kentuckyfriedrice.github.io/StudentRoulette/)

### Background
I made this webpage so I could use it in class to easily pick students.
Many times, students don't want to volunteer in class. Since at my school at least, students are assigned numbers, I took advantage of that system.
We used a different web page before but when our class was being observed, we had a time when an inappropriate advertisement appeared. 
Therefore, I decided to make this despite the many options available.

### How To Use
At the start you will see three boxes. One on the left, two in the center; one nested in the other. 
You will start with twenty-three numbers. You can use the **-** and **+** buttons at the bottom to add or remove numbers. The reset button resets the numbers not including those that have been removed.

*You can click a number to remove that student until a page refresh*

In the middle is a button labeled *Spin*. This is what you would click to initiate the "roulette wheel." There will be random numbers that come up to simulate a roulette wheel spinning to build tension in the classroom. This feature works very well. After a number is selected, you'll notice it appears twice in the box on the left side of the screen. The top list are the numbers as they were called and the bottom list are the numbers in numerical order. The top list allows you to see the order while the bottom allows you to check if a number has been called. This will not include numbers that have been clicked on to remove them from the set. 

I tried making a few themes for each season but I haven't finished those for spring and summer yet.
